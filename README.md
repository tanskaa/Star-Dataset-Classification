# Star Dataset Classification [EN]

Goal: This project is using different classification techniques to a star dataset predicting a target class. Depending on a kind of dataset in a data, both binary and multiclass classification can be used. 

Technologies used: Both binary and multiclass classification were made using such libraries as scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier & AdaBoost Classifier) and tensorflow keras for creating a neural network; matplotlib for visualising the data.
